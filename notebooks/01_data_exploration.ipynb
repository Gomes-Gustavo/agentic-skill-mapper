    "### Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to load the selected dataset (`Google Job Skills`) and perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). This foundational step is crucial to understand the data's structure, identify the relevant information for our project, and prepare it for processing by our AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "1.  **Load Data**: Import the necessary libraries and load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "2.  **Initial Inspection**: Examine the DataFrame's basic properties (shape, columns, data types) to get a first overview.\n",
    "3.  **Identify Key Column**: Pinpoint the specific column containing the job descriptions or responsibilities, which will be the primary input for our `Market_Analyst` agent."

    "### Test Summary\n",
    "The test on a single data entry was a success from a technical standpoint. The end-to-end pipeline—from data preparation in the notebook to the agent's code, through the Ollama server, and back with a structured Pydantic object—functioned flawlessly. This validates the core architecture of our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of AI Agent's Output\n",
    "While technically successful, a critical analysis of the agent's output reveals key areas for future improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hallucination of Technical Skills:** The agent extracted \"AWS\", a skill not explicitly mentioned in the source text. This is a classic example of model hallucination, where the LLM uses its vast general knowledge (\"Cloud Computing\" is often associated with \"AWS\") instead of strictly adhering to the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Inference vs. Extraction of Soft Skills:** The agent correctly inferred soft skills like \"Problem-solving\" and \"Teamwork\" from descriptive phrases. While this demonstrates a sophisticated level of understanding, it deviates from a purely literal extraction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps & Strategy\n",
    "The current agent performance establishes our **baseline**. The observed issues (hallucination and inference) may be specific to this single data point or they could be systemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, attempting to perfect the agent's prompt based on this single sample is inefficient. The logical next step is to proceed with batch processing on a larger dataset. This will allow us to:\n",
    "-   Determine if these behaviors are consistent across many examples.\n",
    "-   Gather quantitative data on the agent's performance.\n",
    "-   Make data-driven decisions on how to iterate and improve the prompt in the next phase of the project."
