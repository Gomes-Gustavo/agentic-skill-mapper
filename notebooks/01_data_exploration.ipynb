    "# Notebook 1: Job Postings Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to load the selected dataset (`Google Job Skills`) and perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). This foundational step is crucial to understand the data's structure, identify the relevant information for our project, and prepare it for processing by our AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "1.  **Load Data**: Import the necessary libraries and load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "2.  **Initial Inspection**: Examine the DataFrame's basic properties (shape, columns, data types) to get a first overview.\n",
    "3.  **Identify Key Column**: Pinpoint the specific column containing the job descriptions or responsibilities, which will be the primary input for our `Market_Analyst` agent."
